# Integrative metagenomics of wild bees reveals urbanization tied to reduced genetic diversity and increased pathogen loads

This repository hosts the scripts and brief methods from our manuscript (title above). This project focused on using mapped and unmapped reads from whole genome sequencing of the small carpenter bee (_Ceratina calcarata_) to obtain population genetic and metagenomic data, respectively.
